## 🛠️ Quick Start Plan (Today!)

### Option 1: Railway.app (Fastest)
```bash
# 1. Sign up: https://railway.app
# 2. Connect your GitHub repo
# 3. Auto-deploy Spring Boot apps
# 4. Get public URLs immediately

Services:
- API Gateway: https://api-woltaxi.railway.app
- User Service: https://user-woltaxi.railway.app
- Driver Service: https://driver-woltaxi.railway.app
```

### Option 2: DigitalOcean VPS (Most Control)
```bash
# 1. Create $5/month droplet (Ubuntu 22.04)
# 2. Install Docker + Docker Compose
# 3. Deploy WOLTAXI services
# 4. Setup Nginx reverse proxy

IP Example: 142.93.123.45
Services:
- API Gateway: http://142.93.123.45:8080
- Admin Panel: http://142.93.123.45:3001
- Driver Portal: http://142.93.123.45:3002
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of both)
```
Frontend: Vercel (free, fast CDN)
- app.woltaxi.com → Vercel
- admin.woltaxi.com → Vercel

Backend: Railway/DigitalOcean
- api.woltaxi.com → Railway/VPS
- MongoDB: Atlas (already setup)
```
